What is a Docker ?

* Docker is a containerization platform for developing, packaging shipping, and running applications.

* It provides the ability to run an application in an isolated environment called a container.

* Makes deployment and development efficient.

What is a Container ?

* A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

* It can be easily shared.

* Makes deployment and development efficient.

Docker Containers Vs VMs

-> Docker Containers                 
 
* Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage
* Sharing, re-building and distribution is easy
* Encapsulate apps instead of whole machine

-> VMs

* High impact on OS,slower, high disk space usage
* Sharing, re-building and distribution is challenging
* Encapsulate whole machine

Main components of Docker

* Dockerfile
* Docker Image
* Docker Container
* Docker Registry


It is a simple text file with instruction to build an image.

===============
Docker Registry
===============
A Docker registry is a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images.

DockerFile===>Image MyApp v1.0===> Docker Hub Or Private Registry===>MyApp v1.0

* What is Docker HUB ?
* Difference Registry vs Repository
* Installation of DOCKER
