What is a Docker ?

* Docker is a containerization platform for developing, packaging shipping, and running applications.

* It provides the ability to run an application in an isolated environment called a container.

* Makes deployment and development efficient.

What is a Container ?

* A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

* It can be easily shared.

* Makes deployment and development efficient.

Docker Containers Vs VMs

-> Docker Containers                 
 
* Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage
* Sharing, re-building and distribution is easy
* Encapsulate apps instead of whole machine

-> VMs

* High impact on OS,slower, high disk space usage
* Sharing, re-building and distribution is challenging
* Encapsulate whole machine

Main components of Docker

* Dockerfile
* Docker Image
* Docker Container
* Docker Registry


It is a simple text file with instruction to build an image.

===============
Docker Registry
===============
A Docker registry is a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images.

DockerFile===>Image MyApp v1.0===> Docker Hub Or Private Registry===>MyApp v1.0

* What is Docker HUB ?
* Difference Registry vs Repository
* Installation of DOCKER
* System Requirement For Windows

> WSL version 1.1.3.0 or later.
> Windows 11 64-bit: Home or Pro version 21H2 or higher, or Enterprise or Education version 21H2 or higher.

>Windows 10 64-bit:

> We recommend Home or Pro 22H2 (build 19045) or higher, or Enterprise or Education 22H2 (build 19045) or higher.
> Minimum required is Home or Pro 21H2 (build 19044) or higher, or Enterprise or Education 21H2 (build 19044) or higher.

                                                      (ctrl + s)
DOCKER IMAGE

# docker build .
# docker image ls

RUN & Manage Docker Containers

                IMAGE ID
# docker run  2f02e42127df

Check running Container

# docker ps
# docker stop <filename>

Run container

# docker run -p 3000:3000 2f02e42127df

Running Container In Detached Mode

# docker run -d -p <Image ID>

Running Multiple Containers

# docker run -d -p 3000:3000 2f02e42127df

# docker run -d -p 3001:3000 2f02e42127df

# docker run -d -p 3002:3000 2f02e42127df

# docker run -d -p 3003:3000 2f02e42127df

Useful Info to Manage Containers

# docker ps -a
# docker rm <filename 1><filename 2><filename 3>
# docker run -d --rm -p 3001:3000 2f02e42127df
# docker ps -a (background runing containers)
