1 File management System

OS store and manage data on disk or partitions using a structure called Filesystem

FileSystem includes files, directories and it's rekated permissions

Unorganized      Organized

It stores data in hierarchy of durectories and files.

Location/path format

> Windows
  . C:\Program Files\Java

> Linux 
  . /etc/folder

Types of File System 
  > ext3
  > ext4
  > XFS
    . {Ubuntu, Debian, Fedoram CentOs, RedHat}
  > BtrFS (B-tree FS)
    . [OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]
  > FAT

  How to check your Linux FileSystem ?

     > lsblk -f
     > df -Th
     > cat/etc/fstab

XFS vs ext4

  > XFS
    . Optimized for large files and volumes, offering superior performance and scalability
  
  > ext4
    . performance well across various file sizes but less efficient with extremely large files

For High-throughput and extensive parallel processing capabilities, XFS is typically more effective than ext4

What in inode ?

   An inode in Linux is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory.

   The filesystem uses the inode number to locate the inode, which then contains pointers to the data blocks
where the actual file data is stored.

   / (root) directory

The Linux filesystem starts at the root directory, denoted by a single slash (/), from which all other files and directories branch out.

> /bin: Contains essential user binaries (executables), such as common commands like ls, cp , etc.

> /etc: Holds system configuration files
   Ex: User, Network, Services, System Apps
  
> /home: Contains the personal directories of all users.

> /root: The home directory for the root user (administrator)

> /var: Where variable data such as logs and databases are stored.

> /tmp: Temporary files created by system and users . 

 less /etc/passwd

> /boot - Holds files needed for system boot-up, including the Linux kernel, an initial RAM disk image, bootloader configuration (like GRUB).

> /dev - This directory contains files which represent and provide access to hardware devices such as hard drives, sound devices etc.

> /lib,/lib64 - These directories contain essential shared libraries and kernel modules that are needed to boot the system and run the commands in the root filesystem. The /lib64 directory exists on systems that support 64-bit applications

> /media - This is the mount point for removable media such as USB drives. CD-ROMs,etc. When these devices are mounted, typically, directories corresponding to their mount points are created within /media. 

> /mnt - Similar to /media, this is a traditional mount point where system administrators can mount Temporary filesystems while using or configuring them.

> /opt - Intended for the installation of add-on appliction software packages. Large software packages that are not part of the default installation can be placed here to avoid cluttering the system directories.

> /proc - A virtual and dynamic directory as it only exists in memory. It does not use disk space. It contains information about system resources, hardware, and running processes. It,s a pseudo-filesystem then provides an interface to kernel data structures.

> /run - A Temporary filesystem that stores transient state files, like process IDs or lock files, since it is cleared and recreated at every boot.

> /sbin - Contains binary (executable) files that are mostly needed by the system administrator. These include system management commands like fdisk, shutdown,ip,etc.

> /srv - Contains data which servers hosted on the system may need, such as web pages served by a web server.

> /sys - Similar to / proc, this is another virtual filesystem that provides an interface to the kernal. It contains information and settings about the system's devices, drivers, and some kernal features

> /usr - Considered the secondary hierarchy because it contain all user applications and a variety of other things for day-to-day operations, including libraries, documebtations, and much more. Subdirectories include /usr/bin,/usr/sbin,/usr/local, and /usr/share, among others.

2. Linux Packages management

 Topics  

> What is package management ?
> Packages management tools 
   . yum
   . dnf
   . rpm
   . apt 
> Difference between Upgrade or Update ?
> Rollback the patches or updates

Packages management
   
   It's all about packages

     > Installing
     > Upgrading
     > Deleting
     > View Packages Info 
     > Packages config

> manage software using YUM/DNF and RPM for your Red Hat-based Linux systems like CentOs

> APT for Debian and based, Ubuntu, Kali Linux etc

YUM YELLOW-DOG UPDATER MODUFIED

> YUM is the primary package management tool for redhat .

> YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating, and removing software packages .

> YUM can manage package from installed repositories in the system or from . rpm packages.

. How to install and remove a package
   # yum install nginx -y
   # yum remove nginx

. How to upgrade and update a package
   # yum upgrade package
   # yum update package

> What is the difference between
  yum Update & Upgrade

Upgrade: Will delete the old Packages
Update: Keep the old packages, we can rollback

YUM COMMANDS

> you can see all the options using
  # yum -option

> To check the available updates for packages
  # yum check-update

package RollBack 

> To see the past work done related to package, which will show you the activity with date and time
  # yum history

> We can simply undo or redo any action using
  # yum history undo/redo <id>

RPM REDHAT PACKAGE MANAGER

> Using RPM, you can install, uninstall, and query in
