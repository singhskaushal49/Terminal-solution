OS store and manage data on disk or partitions using a structure called Filesystem

FileSystem includes files, directories and it's rekated permissions

Unorganized      Organized

It stores data in hierarchy of durectories and files.

Location/path format

> Windows
  . C:\Program Files\Java

> Linux 
  . /etc/folder

Types of File System 
  > ext3
  > ext4
  > XFS
    . {Ubuntu, Debian, Fedoram CentOs, RedHat}
  > BtrFS (B-tree FS)
    . [OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]
  > FAT

  How to check your Linux FileSystem ?

     > lsblk -f
     > df -Th
     > cat/etc/fstab

XFS vs ext4

  > XFS
    . Optimized for large files and volumes, offering superior performance and scalability
  
  > ext4
    . performance well across various file sizes but less efficient with extremely large files

For High-throughput and extensive parallel processing capabilities, XFS is typically more effective than ext4

What in inode ?

   An inode in Linux is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory.

   The filesystem uses the inode number to locate the inode, which then contains pointers to the data blocks
where the actual file data is stored.

   / (root) directory

The Linux filesystem starts at the root directory, denoted by a single slash (/), from which all other files and directories branch out.

> /bin: Contains essential user binaries (executables), such as common commands like ls, cp , etc.

> /etc: Holds system configuration files
   Ex: User, Network, Services, System Apps
  
> /home: Contains the personal directories of all users.

> /root: The home directory for the root user (administrator)

> /var: Where variable data such as logs and databases are stored.

> /tmp: Temporary files created by system and users . 

 less /etc/passwd

> /boot - Holds files needed for system boot-up, including the Linux kernel, an initial RAM disk image, bootloader configuration (like GRUB).

> /dev - This directory contains files which represent and provide access to hardware devices such as hard drives, sound devices etc.

> /lib,/lib64 - These directories contain essential shared libraries and kernel modules that are needed to boot the system and run the commands in the root filesystem. The /lib64 directory exists on systems that support 64-bit applications

> /media - This is the mount point for removable media such as USB drives. CD-ROMs,etc. When these devices are mounted, typically, directories corresponding to their mount points are created within /media. 

> /mnt - Similar to /media, this is a traditional mount point where system administrators can mount Temporary filesystems while using or configuring them.

> /opt - Intended for the installation of add-on appliction software packages. Large software
